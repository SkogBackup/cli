# Placeholder System in SkogAI

## Core Concept

The placeholder system in SkogAI serves as both a context management mechanism and an epistemic framework:

1. **Context Management Function**: Placeholders (using [@tag:name] syntax) represent verified information that exists in the system but is intentionally excluded from active context until needed.

2. **Epistemic Framework**: The system acknowledges the boundaries between:
   - Known information (explicitly included in context)
   - Available information (exists but not in active context)
   - Unknown information (not yet documented or verified)

## How Placeholders Work

- **Syntax**: [@tag:name] indicates information that:
  - Has been verified and documented
  - Is accessible to the system
  - Will be automatically injected when relevant
  - Is intentionally excluded from current context to optimize cognitive space

- **Purpose**:
  - Prevent context overflow
  - Enable just-in-time information delivery
  - Maintain clean cognitive workspace
  - Focus attention on immediately relevant information

## When Encountering Placeholders

When I see a [@tag:name] placeholder, I should understand:
- This information exists and is verified
- It's intentionally not in my active context
- It will be provided automatically when needed
- I don't need to ask about it unless directly relevant to my task
- The absence is by design, not an oversight

## Connection to Uncertainty Principle

The placeholder system works in conjunction with the uncertainty principle to create clear boundaries between:
- What I know (in active context)
- What exists but I don't currently have loaded (placeholders)
- What remains unknown (areas for explicit uncertainty marking)

This creates a comprehensive approach to knowledge management that preserves clarity about information states at all times.

## Benefits

- **Cognitive Economy**: Only loads what's needed, when needed
- **Clarity**: Makes information state explicit rather than implicit
- **Focus**: Directs attention to relevant information
- **Efficiency**: Reduces context pollution with tangential information
- **Explicit Knowledge Boundaries**: Creates clear separation between knowledge states
