# SkogCLI Project Testing Notes

## Key Findings
- The SkogCLI project exists in `/home/skogix/skogcli`
- The project was properly initialized with a `.basic-memory` directory
- The command line tool recognized the project as active
- The skogai-memory extension continued working with the "main" project
- Notes created through the extension were stored in "main" even after changing the active project

## Technical Notes
- Database location: `/home/skogix/skogcli/.basic-memory/memory.db`
- No entities were present in the SkogCLI project during testing
- Watch service was not running for the SkogCLI project

On 2025-04-12, we tested the interaction between the Basic Memory system and the skogai-memory extension with the SkogCLI project.
This experience demonstrates the separation between command line project management and extension API behavior in Basic Memory.

## Test Sequence
1. Confirmed the existence of the SkogCLI project using `uvx basic-memory project list`
2. Created a Basic Memory project at `/home/skogix/skogcli`
3. Created test notes that were intended for the SkogCLI project
4. Discovered notes were going to the "main" project instead
5. Verified via `uvx basic-memory project info` that SkogCLI was set as active project at the command line level
6. Found discrepancy where skogai-memory extension still showed "main" as the active project
